				<h1 class="section-heading">Investigating Low Oxygen Methods to prevent cancer from spreading by Reduce Blood Vessel Growth</h1>
				<p>
				Dr. Beischlag would like to examines how hypoxia, or low oxygen "promotes" the spread of cancer throughout the body. Dr. Beischlag's lab has identified an unrecognized mode of regulation of hypoxia-controlled gene expression and intends to exploit this to develop better therapeutic anti-cancer agents and strategies. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF’s) regulate gene expression in response to low oxygen tension. This includes the formation of new blood vessels, and the biochemical transformation of cancer cells into more lethal, mobile forms. Evidence suggests that the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, reduces the physiological response to low oxygen by HIF’s. Mutations that eliminate Rb function cause uncontrolled HIF activity and promote the formation of new blood vessels and tumour progression. In addition, loss of Rb leads to aggressive cellular behaviour in the human breast and prostate cancer cell lines. The hypothesis that Dr. Beischlag's lab is pursuing is that loss of Rb results in uncontrolled expression of hypoxia-regulated factors. Targeting the factors regulating the growth of vasculature has been an attractive strategy for the development of therapies in cancer. However, these approaches are limited. If therapies that fight cancer progression are to be improved, the multiple factors regulating metastasis including cell invasion must be targeted.

				<p>Dr. Beischlag received his PhD from the University of Toronto in 1996. There he cloned and studied the transcriptional regulation of dopamine receptor genes. Following his PhD, Dr. Beischlag’s post-doctoral research began at the University of California/Los Angeles where he studied and characterized the molecular determinants of aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated gene transcription. He continued this work at the University of California/San Diego. In 2004, Dr. Beischlag joined the Center for Molecular Toxicology and Carcinogenesis at Pennsylvania State University as an assistant research professor. Dr. Beischlag joined the Faculty of Health Sciences in 2007.</p>
